this is a new year with many changes coming to my life, I have stumbled and fell over the years but somehow somewhere, I still found the energy to get up again and keep going because na who give fuck up.

The various experiences that life has taught me, is the pillar on top which i incline when life adversities come through, am still young but many elderly people are yet to pass through my experiences.

This past week has given me another perspective of living life through constant struggle of trying to fix things to the owners pleasure, which may or may not attract equal reward, to settle some of the petty the work has done to the human body.

This new week I am planning to switch over to a more sweatless streams of income which will provide the same advantages as to my previous one, with a less physical stressing ability, which can rip off the remaining strength in me before i go home.
